> # Machine Learning Assignments of Linear Regression for Housing Price

In this Project we will make Linear Regression model for simple Housing prizing problem using Python. In this Project we are not using any machine learning but insteed we develop function by self.

This way we can learn very basic way to implement machine learning.
